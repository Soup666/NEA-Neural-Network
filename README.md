# NEA Neural Network
This github repo is dedicated to my NEA project about neural networks. In here you will find a handful of different versions of the same neural network I have created from scratch. The EMNIST and MNIST directorys are the main attraction, EMNIST is the letter dataset and MNIST is the digit dataset. These bith include a copy of the same neural network adapted for the datasets.

The MNIST clean is just a cleaned up version of the Neural Network with the intent to print off or display. This is outdated now, however, since I added to the neural network when adapting it for the datasets

The Most up to date version is the EMNIST one since I did this last

If you also want to try drawing your own digit, the MNIST clean version has the ability to do so but its still under production. 

The .exe for these are located in bin/debug
